To build the PS2 part of PS2rd, you need a working PS2DEV toolchain with an
up-to-date version of the PS2SDK. The easiest way to get both is docker-ps2dev:
https://github.com/mlafeldt/docker-ps2dev

When everything is set up, go to PS2rd's root directory and run

	$ make

This will create the executable ee/loader/ps2rd.elf.

The beginning of the Makefile documents many variables that affect the way PS2rd
is built. You can override them either from the command line, or in the
config.mak file. Take a look at config.mak.sample for a sample configuration.

To directly run the compiled ELF with ps2client, do

	$ make run

Last but not least, note that PS2rd requires a high-loading version of ps2link.
